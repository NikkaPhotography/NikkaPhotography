Hi there, thanks for stopping by! My name is Nikka, I'm a Winnipeg based amateur photographer who would love to work with you! I'm 25 years old and currently working on my second degree, in Social Work.

I've been playing with cameras and photography for 7 years now, and I specialize in portraits, engagement sessions, maternity sessions and family sessions. I also have a couple weddings under my belt, and I'd love to second shoot for your photographer or take the lead.

Basically, I'm most interested in capturing connections between people, regardless of the type of session. Those "magic" moments between smiling for the camera where the warmth of your relationship really shines. If that's what you're looking for, drop me a line, I'd love to hear from you!
