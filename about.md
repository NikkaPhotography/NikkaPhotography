Hi there, thanks for stopping by! My name is Nikka, I'm a Winnipeg based amateur photographer who would love to work with you! I'm 25 years old and currently working on my second degree, in Social Work.

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">I've been playing with cameras and </span>photography<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> for 7 years now, and I specialize in portraits, engagement sessions, maternity sessions and family sessions. I also have a couple weddings under my belt, and I'd love to second shoot for your photographer or take the lead. </span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Basically, I'm most interested in capturing connections between people, regardless of the </span>type<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> of session. Those "magic" moments between smiling for the </span>camrea<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> where the warmth of your relationship really shines. If that's what you're looking for, drop me a line, I'd love to hear from you!</span>
