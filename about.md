Hi there, thanks for stopping by! My name is Nikka, I'm a Winnipeg based amateur photographer who would love to work with you! I'm 25 years old and currently working on my second degree, in Social Work.

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">I've been playing with cameras and&nbsp;</span>photography<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;for 7 years now, and I&nbsp;specialize in portraits, engagement sessions, maternity sessions and family sessions. I also have a couple weddings under my belt and if you're interested in hiring me for yours, I'd love to chat with you about it!&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">I'm most interested in capturing connections between people, regardless of the&nbsp;</span>type<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;of session. Those "magic" moments between smiling for the&nbsp;</span>camrea<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;where the warmth of your relationship really shines. If this sounds like the kind of thing you're also interested in, drop me a line!</span>
